'How to Count Komodo Dragons||How do you count Komodo ***dragons---a legendary creature***? With some cameras and the element of ##1surprise##.||Camera traps are frequently used to take pictures and monitor populations of large mammals like tigers and leopards, but until now, they haven\'t been used often to count Komodo dragons-the world\'s largest lizards-or other reptiles and amphibians.``2||Recent research suggests that they can and should be used to keep tabs on these animals, and that cameras may beat the physical traps currently used to monitor Komodo dragon populations. ^^5||Camera traps work by taking pictures when alerted to the presence of an animal by a motion detector, often an infrared one that detects heat. ^^5That\'s a potential ##4problem## for reptiles and amphibians, which are cold-blooded, and thus often have the same temperature as the surrounding environment. ^^5``3||^^5But the study, published online last week in the journal ++PLOS ONE++, found that cameras worked about as well as traps at detecting the presence of Komodo dragons-and, in certain areas, did even better. Plus, they require much less manpower to operate, and are far less expensive. With cameras, there is also no need to set up a large trap, bait it with goat meat and free the animal afterward.``3____1::1::What does the word ##surprise## mean?::unexpectedness||development||thrill||danger::1---2::1::According to paragraph 2, when do cameras start to monitor Komodo dragons?::Ancient times||19th century||In near future||At present::4---4::1::What is the relationship between paragraph 4 and 5?::Cause and result||Contrasting||Emphasizing||Highlighting::2---4::2::What does the ##problem## refer to?::extinguishing||over-breeding||environment change||human hunting::13---3::4::The research has been a breakthrough.::1---all::6::A recent research has successfully counted the population of Komodo dragons.::Choice 1||Choice 2||Choice 3||Choice 4||Choice 5||Choice 6::136',


'First Mini-Supernovas Discovered||Astronomers have discovered a new kind of supernova, a star explosion so weak that scientists dubbed it a miniature stellar blast.``1||Supernovas represent the deaths of stars, which collapse in powerful explosions. They generally are classified into two main types; the new class, called Type Iax, "is essentially a mini-supernova," said lead researcher Ryan Foley, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. "It\'s the runt of the supernova litter."||Supernovas are the most powerful stellar explosions known to science, visible all the way to the edge of the universe. ##2The first of the two main flavors, Type Ia supernovas, happen after a white dwarf star dies from siphoning off too much mass from a companion star.## In contrast, Type II supernovas occur after the core of a star about 10 to 100 times as massive as the sun runs out of fuel and collapses into an extraordinarily dense lump in a fraction of a second, blasting luminous radiation outward.||In 2002, researchers began noticing that many supernovas appeared to be similar to regular Type Ia supernovas, but were distinctly fainter. Some shone with only 1 percent of the peak luminosity of Type Ia supernovas. Now, based on past and new observations, Foley and his colleagues have identified 25 examples of what they call Type Iax supernovas.||"This really is a new kind of stellar explosion," Foley told ++SPACE.com++.____1::1::What is the function of paragraph 1?::Choice 1||Choice 2||Choice 3||Choice 4::2---3::1::Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?

'DDT Linked to High Blood Pressure in Women||Women exposed before birth to the banned pesticide DDT may have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure later in life, according to a study published today.||The study of San Francisco Bay Area women is the first to link DDT exposure in the womb to hypertension, which raises the risk of stroke and heart disease.``1||A widely used insecticide, DDT was banned in the United States in 1972 because it was building up in the environment. It is still used in Africa to combat malaria-infected mosquitoes.||"Our findings suggest that DDT may be targeting the system in the body that keeps blood pressure under control," said Michele La Merrill, a toxicologist at the University of California, Davis and lead author of the study published today in Environmental Health Perspectives.||In previous research, pesticide applicators with high blood pressure had higher DDT exposures than those with healthy blood pressure. Research also has suggested that DDT interferes with hormones, and it has been linked to decreased fertility, preterm delivery and diabetes.||In the new study, more than 500 women born between 1959 and 1967 participated. They were the daughters of more than 15,000 women from the Oakland area who were recruited by scientists to investigate how environmental exposures, even those that occur before birth, can affect health over a lifetime.||Because DDT can pass to the child through the placenta, the blood of the mothers, collected shortly before or after birth, served as a proxy for fetal exposure.||Several decades later, 111 of the daughters, 21 percent, reported having been diagnosed with hypertension.||Overall, the women in the highest two-thirds of prenatal DDT exposure were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to develop high blood pressure before age 50 than women in the lowest one-third of exposure.||"We are now seeing the potential long-term health consequences of introducing chemicals whose safety we know very little about," said Jonathan Chevrier, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who did not participate in the new study.||Almost one-third of adult U.S. women have hypertension, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prevalence in postmenopausal women is much greater than in premenopausal women.||The researchers found that the association between DDT and high blood pressure held after accounting for some factors known to raise the risk of hypertension, including age, race, body mass and diabetes status.||However, it is unclear how factors they did not test, such as how much salt a person eats, may have affected the findings.||It also is impossible to know whether some women had undiagnosed high blood pressure or how blood pressure levels differed across exposure groups.||"The degree of hypertension matters in terms of clinical significance, so from a clinical perspective it\'s hard to say anything about the relative importance of the findings," said Dr. Ted Schettler, science director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, a non-profit organization.||However, he added, "anything that raises the blood pressure of an entire population, even a small amount, can have large public health consequences."||DDT breaks down slowly, so most people alive today have traces in their bodies, and it remains in the environment and the food web.____1::1::According to paragraph 2, what is the risk of DDT exposure?::Choice 1||Choice 2||Choice 3||Choice 4::2---all::6::DDT breaks down slowly.::Choice 1||Choice 2||Choice 3||Choice 4||Choice 5||Choice 6::123'
